## Changelog

### v1.1.0

**Bug Fixes:**
- **PreDelay fix**: Fixed PreDelay parameter not being applied to DSP. Now correctly feeds both ER and FDN paths.
- **Metallic comb-filter artifact fix**: Addressed metallic ringing at long DecayTime values with four countermeasures: DC blocker in FDN loop, decay-dependent micro-saturation blend, modulation depth scaling, and dynamic nested allpass modulation.
- **Preset PRO Mode fix**: Fixed PRO Mode state being incorrectly restored on preset load. Now always resets to Normal mode.

**Sound Quality Improvements:**
- **Chorus-style pitch modulation**: Added sine-wave LFO (ChorusLFO) per FDN channel with golden-ratio phase/rate distribution, layered on top of the existing noise LFO for richer, more organic tail texture.
- **3-stage serial allpass chain**: Expanded nested allpass from 1 stage to 3 serial stages per FDN channel with varied delay times and modulation depths, greatly increasing late-field echo density.
- **ER→Late reverb transition smoothing**: Early reflection output is now fed into the FDN input at 15% blend, simulating the natural transition from early reflections to late reverberation.
- **Frequency-dependent modulation**: Modulation depth now scales per FDN channel (1.5× for short-delay/HF channels, 0.5× for long-delay/LF channels), matching the physical behavior of air turbulence.
- **Soft-knee RMS compression in FDN loop**: Added per-channel RMS envelope follower with soft-knee compression (threshold 0.35), providing transparent level control without harmonic distortion.
- **Thiran allpass fractional delay interpolation**: Replaced linear interpolation with 1st-order Thiran allpass for FDN main delay lines, achieving flat magnitude response (|H(ω)|=1) and preserving high-frequency clarity in the feedback loop.

**CPU Optimizations:**
- Replaced `std::sin()` in chorus LFO with parabolic sine approximation (5-10× faster, <0.1% error).
- Moved `std::sqrt()` in soft-knee compression inside threshold branch (only computed when compression is active).
- Precomputed all loop-invariant values: frequency-dependent modulation scales, input diffuser delays, allpass base delays (16ch × 3 stages), ER tap gains, and allpass gain stage.
- Cached sample rate as float to eliminate repeated double→float casts in the hot path.

## Overview

**Ambience** is a high-quality, open-source algorithmic reverb VST3 plugin built on a **16-channel Feedback Delay Network (FDN)** architecture. Designed with professional audio standards in mind, it delivers rich, natural-sounding reverberation ranging from intimate studio rooms to vast concert halls and beyond — with the precision and stability demanded by real-world production environments.

Ambience ships with **21 factory presets** modeled after some of the world's most iconic acoustic spaces, including Abbey Road Studio 1 & 2, Vienna Musikverein, Amsterdam Concertgebouw, Boston Symphony Hall, Carnegie Hall, and more. Whether you need a tight drum room, a lush orchestral hall, a vintage plate, or an infinite ambient space, Ambience covers it all.

## Key Features

### 🏛️ 16-Channel FDN Reverb Engine

A research-grade Feedback Delay Network forms the acoustic core of Ambience:

* **16-channel FWHT Feedback Matrix:** Fast Walsh-Hadamard Transform ensures dense, colorless diffusion with optimal mode distribution.
* **Nearest-Prime Delay Allocation:** Delay lines are tuned to unique prime numbers distributed on a logarithmic scale, guaranteeing mutual coprimality across all 16 channels and eliminating comb-filter artifacts at any room size.
* **7 Reverb Algorithms:** ROOM1 / ROOM2 / HALL1 / HALL2 / PLATE / SPRING / GOLDFOIL — each with distinct topological routing, Allpass gain, and ER patterns.

### 🎛️ Professional DSP Modules

* **Stage 2 GEQ Absorption (Välimäki-Liski):** A 10-band biquad Graphic EQ cascade per FDN channel, solving a Weighted Least Squares system to achieve accurate, frequency-dependent RT60 targets across the full audible spectrum.
* **ISM-Based Early Reflections:** Image Source Method patterns tuned per algorithm, providing perceptually accurate pre-echo with full stereo imaging control.
* **BandlimitedNoise LFO:** Each of the 16 FDN channels is driven by an independent, mutually asynchronous low-frequency oscillator using a white noise source filtered by a 1st-order IIR — initialized via the Golden Ratio Weyl sequence to guarantee non-periodic modulation.
* **ADAA Saturator (4 Modes):** Anti-Derivative Anti-Aliasing saturation applied to the wet path. Modes: **Warm** (Vicanek x/√(1+x²)), **Tape** (Padé rational polynomial), **Tube** (asymmetric ADAA for even-order harmonics), **Hard** (hard clip + ADAA).
* **Micro-Saturation (FDN Loop):** An internal Padé saturator in the FDN feedback loop acts as a safety limiter, suppressing limit cycles without audible coloration.
* **Output EQ:** Linkwitz-Riley 12 dB/oct Lo Cut (20–500 Hz) and Hi Cut (1 kHz–20 kHz) applied exclusively to the wet path.
* **Brick-Wall Output Limiter:** -0.5 dBFS brick-wall limiter as the final stage, transparent under normal use.
* **Ducking:** Sidechain-style envelope follower with independent Threshold, Amount, Attack, and Release controls.

### 📊 Real-Time Visualizers

* **RT60 Graph:** Displays 10-band RT60 curves (31 Hz – 16 kHz) in logarithmic scale. The orange curve shows the actual effective RT60 (including HF Damping and LF Absorption), while the gray curve shows the raw preset reference. The Y-axis dynamically scales to the current decay time.
* **Decay Curve Visualizer:** A split time-axis display showing Early Reflections (0–200 ms, expanded 2×) and Late Reverb decay curve side-by-side, with color-coded ER tap markers and envelope fill.
* **Acoustic Metrics:** Live readout of D50 (%), C50 (dB), C80 (dB), and EDT (s) derived from real-time signal analysis.

### 🎚️ Pro Mode

##
<img src="Source/Assets/Screenshot2.jpg" width="600">

Unlock deep per-band control:

* **10-Band RT60 Multiplier:** Fine-tune the RT60 curve at each octave band (31 Hz – 16 kHz) independently.
* **Tilt EQ × 3:** Broad spectral tilt controls for Low / Mid / High regions.
* **Saturation Type Selector:** Choose from Warm / Tape / Tube / Hard within Pro Mode.
* **Output EQ:** Lo Cut and Hi Cut knobs available in both Normal and Pro Mode panels.

### 💾 Preset Management

* **File-Based Preset System:** Presets are saved as `.ambpreset` files — a standard binary XML format compatible with JUCE's state management system.
* **21 Factory Presets:** Modeled after real-world acoustic spaces across all 7 reverb algorithm types.
* **SAVE / LOAD / DELETE / PREV / NEXT:** Full preset browser UI integrated directly into the main panel.
* **Shareable:** Simply share `.ambpreset` files directly with other users — no installation required.

### ⚡ Real-Time Safety & DAW Compatibility

Built to the strictest real-time audio standards, with specific hardening for Ableton Live:

* **Zero Heap Allocation on Audio Thread:** All buffers pre-allocated in `prepareToPlay()`. No `new` / `malloc` / `std::vector::resize()` calls in `processBlock()`.
* **Dirty-Flag Parameter Dispatch:** `setParams()` is called only when DSP parameters change, preventing the expensive Stage 2 GEQ WLS matrix computation (16 ch × 10-band LDLT) from running unnecessarily every buffer.
* **Ableton Live Sample-Rate Jitter Protection:** A mismatch guard at the top of `processBlock()` detects asynchronous sample-rate changes (a known Ableton Live edge case) and triggers a safe internal reset.
* **ScopedNoDenormals:** Applied at the entry of every `processBlock()` call to suppress denormal CPU spikes.
* **SmoothedValue Gain:** Wet and Dry gain changes are interpolated sample-accurately to eliminate zipper noise under automation.
* **Safe Editor Destruction:** `stopTimer()` and `setLookAndFeel(nullptr)` are called explicitly in the Editor destructor to prevent Ableton Live cleanup-order crashes.

### Preset File Location

Factory presets and user presets are stored at:

```
Windows: C:\Users\<YourName>\Documents\Ambience\Presets\
```

Each preset is saved as a `.ambpreset` file (binary XML containing all plugin parameters).

### Sharing Presets

To share presets with other users:

1. Navigate to `Documents\Ambience\Presets\`
2. Copy the desired `.ambpreset` file(s)
3. Send the file(s) to the recipient

Recipients simply place the `.ambpreset` files into their own `Documents\Ambience\Presets\` folder. The presets will appear automatically in the Ambience preset browser on the next plugin load.

> **Tip:** You can also ZIP the entire `Presets` folder to share your complete preset library at once.

### Preset Compatibility

Presets use JUCE's standard state serialization. Future versions of Ambience will remain forward-compatible — unknown parameters in older presets are silently ignored, and missing parameters fall back to their default values.
